Contents:

- 3 data files each for 7 emissions species (SO2, NOx, BC, OC, NH3, NMVOC, and CO) including global emissions by sector, total emissions by country, and emissions by sector and country. Emissions for CO2 are not yet finalized, but will be posted on the project web site as soon as they are released (http://www.globalchange.umd.edu/CEDS/) and also will be included in this data supplement for the final published version of this manuscript. Gridded CO2 emissions will be published through ESGF.

- One file country_mapping.csv contains a mapping of country names to 3 digit ISO codes, IEA country name/region, and aggregate region used in the figures in this paper. As noted in the paper, this data version is being released at the IEA country level so that emissions data is consistent across species. Data for individual countries grouped into IEA aggregate regions (e.g., “Other Africa”, “Other Asia”, and "Other S. & Cent. America") is also available on request.

Note that country totals in these summary files do not include international shipping or aircraft emissions.

International shipping and aircraft emissions are reported under the "global" iso.
